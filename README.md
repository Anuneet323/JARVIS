## 🚀 Overview

**JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is a web-based voice assistant inspired by Tony Stark’s futuristic AI.  
It listens, responds, and performs tasks such as opening websites, telling the time, giving greetings, and more — all powered by **Web Speech API** and **modern JavaScript**.

🎙️ Just say “Hey Jarvis!” and start talking — it listens and talks back!

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The browser listens using **`SpeechRecognition`**  
2. Captures your voice and converts it to text  
3. Matches your command with known phrases (like "open YouTube")  
4. Executes the corresponding action (opens tab, speaks, etc.)  
5. Responds vocally using **`SpeechSynthesis`**
